#Checkoff 3 code


##changingLightbulbs (final 1D code)
*How many of you does it take to change a lightbulb?*

*How many tries will you need to switch them all off?*

You are the blinking LED. Move around the lighted LEDs in the cube to switch them off, but beware! Once a LED is switched off, you can't go back there anymore.

##Additional mojo test projects
Some of the smaller projects we started out with to test out each component individually before combining them:

###Button (done by Zanette)
Takes input from external button to increment a counter

###FSM (done by Si-Yan)
Main state machine for game, with modules for external button input and output to LED cube (can use buttons to move up/ down/ left/ right/ forward/ backward)

##Note
To use the IO Shield, it's required to have the io_shield.ucf in constrains. This is not stated in the tutorial
