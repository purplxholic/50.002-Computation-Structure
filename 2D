32-bit adder optimization:
using techniques from combinational logic synthesis and timing specification

Milestones
Deliverable 1: You need to submit the optimized design netlist of the 32-bit adder using the JSim and 50.002 Checkoff system. The system will compare for plagiarism or duplicate copy.

Deliverable 2: You need to submit the source code for the CEC-SAT verification software (SAT Solver).

Deliverable 3: You need to submit a short report on the implementation and analysis of your 2-SAT algorithm.

Deliverable 4: You need to demo/present to instructors on your optimized hardware and CEC-SAT Solver. The execution time of your SAT Solver will be tested by our provided .cnf file (about 6000 clauses).

Deliverables 1-3 must be submitted by Friday, 4th of November 2016.

Deliverable 4 (Demo) will be on Friday, 4th of November 2016.
